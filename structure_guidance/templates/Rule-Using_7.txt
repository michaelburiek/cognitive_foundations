You are solving a rule-using problem, which has a clear purpose or goal that is constrained by rules or principles but not restricted to a single specific procedure. Rule-using problems require applying domain rules flexibly to achieve well-defined objectives.

# Reasoning Structure for Rule-Using Problems

Follow this structured reasoning approach optimized for rule-using problems:

## Phase 1: Selective Attention
**Goal**: Identify the relevant rules, constraints, and goal specifications.
- Extract the key rules, principles, or constraints that apply
- Identify the target goal or objective to achieve
- Filter out information that doesn't affect which rules to apply
- Focus on the conditions that trigger or constrain rule application

↓ Then organize your approach ↓

## Phase 2: Sequential Organization
**Goal**: Structure your rule application process in logical stages.
- Plan the sequence of rule applications needed
- Organize your reasoning into ordered phases or steps
- Recognize that some rules must be applied before others
- Establish a progression from initial state toward the goal

|| While simultaneously managing multiple strategic aspects ||

## Phase 3: Backward Chaining (parallel)
**Goal**: Work backward from the goal to identify what rules must be satisfied.
- Start with the desired outcome and identify prerequisites
- Determine which conditions must be true for the goal to be achieved
- Recursively identify what rules need to be satisfied to meet each condition
- Work backward through dependencies to find a path from current state to goal

|| At the same time ||

## Phase 4: Goal Management (parallel)
**Goal**: Track and maintain focus on objectives throughout reasoning.
- Keep the primary goal active while working through rule applications
- Manage subgoals that emerge from rule constraints
- Monitor progress toward the objective as rules are applied
- Adjust goals if new information reveals better approaches

|| At the same time ||

## Phase 5: Spatial Organization (parallel)
**Goal**: Represent relationships between elements spatially where relevant.
- Organize problem elements according to spatial relationships if applicable (positions, arrangements, configurations)
- Track relative positions or layouts that affect rule application
- Consider spatial constraints imposed by rules
- Visualize spatial configurations that result from applying rules

↓ All parallel reasoning converges to ↓

## Phase 6: Context-Awareness (containing Decomposition and Integration)
**Goal**: Align your rule application with the specific problem domain and context.

Recognize domain-specific conventions for how rules are typically applied in this context. Within this context-sensitive reasoning:

**Embedded Behavior - Decomposition and Integration**: Break the problem into rule-governed subproblems
- Decompose the problem into components where different rules apply
- Solve each component by applying relevant rules independently
- Integrate partial solutions while ensuring rules are satisfied across boundaries
- Synthesize component results into a coherent solution that meets all constraints
