You are solving a **diagnosis–solution problem**, which involves (1) diagnosing the underlying cause 
of an issue and (2) proposing a justified solution tailored to the diagnosed cause. These problems 
require identifying core signals, aligning them with relevant knowledge structures, reasoning 
forward from possible causes, and selecting a strategy that leads to a coherent, conceptually grounded 
solution.

# Reasoning Structure for Diagnosis–Solution Problems

Follow this optimized reasoning structure. The flow of reasoning is:

**selective-attention → sequential-organization → knowledge-structure-alignment → forward-chaining 
(containing strategy-selection) → strategy-selection → conceptual-level-processing ∥ causal-organization**

---

## Phase 1: Selective Attention
**Goal**: Identify the meaningful diagnostic cues in the problem.
- Extract key symptoms, constraints, or signals
- Separate high-value information from noise
- Highlight the central issue requiring explanation or correction
- Identify what is missing or ambiguous in the problem description

↓ Use the extracted information to structure your path forward ↓

## Phase 2: Sequential Organization
**Goal**: Create an ordered diagnostic–solution workflow.
- Break the problem into steps: observe → diagnose → infer → propose solution
- Ensure each step logically depends on the previous one
- Move cleanly from evidence to diagnosis, and from diagnosis to solution
- Maintain a transparent, stepwise flow

↓ Connect the sequence to relevant knowledge structures ↓

## Phase 3: Knowledge Structure Alignment
**Goal**: Match identified signs and steps to relevant conceptual frameworks.
- Map symptoms or observations onto known categories, models, or principles
- Align the problem with diagnostic schemas (e.g., known failure modes, conceptual taxonomies)
- Identify where the problem fits within established knowledge domains
- Use structured knowledge to constrain possible diagnoses

↓ Use aligned knowledge to reason forward through consequences ↓

## Phase 4: Forward Chaining (containing Strategy Selection)
**Goal**: Push implications forward from hypothesized causes to check consistency.
- Infer what should follow if a hypothesized cause is correct
- Compare those predicted outcomes to the observed facts
- Narrow down plausible diagnoses based on consistency
- Strengthen or eliminate hypotheses through logical propagation

Within this forward reasoning:

### Embedded Behavior — Strategy Selection
**Goal**: Choose the most suitable diagnostic and solution strategies.
- Identify which reasoning or intervention approach best matches the aligned knowledge structure
- Consider different solution pathways and evaluate their feasibility
- Select the strategy that offers the highest diagnostic clarity or problem resolution
- Justify why this approach is preferable to alternatives

↓ Develop a conceptually deep and coherent explanation ↓

## Phase 5: Conceptual-Level Processing (parallel with Causal Organization)
**Goal**: Ground your diagnosis and solution in core principles, not superficial symptoms.
- Explain the issue using underlying concepts or mechanisms
- Ensure the proposed solution addresses the conceptual root of the problem
- Generalize the reasoning when useful (e.g., principle-based explanation)
- Tie the diagnosis to higher-order understanding

|| In parallel ||

## Phase 6: Causal Organization
**Goal**: Construct a clear causal chain linking observations → causes → consequences → solution.
- Organize the explanation around cause-and-effect relationships
- Identify the initiating cause and trace its downstream effects
- Ensure your solution directly targets the identified causal pathway
- Present a cohesive causal narrative

# Your Task
Apply this full reasoning structure to solve the diagnosis–solution problem. Make your reasoning explicit by:
1. Identifying key signals using selective attention  
2. Structuring your workflow sequentially  
3. Aligning the problem with relevant knowledge structures  
4. Using forward chaining to test diagnostic hypotheses  
5. Selecting an appropriate strategy for solving the issue  
6. Demonstrating conceptual understanding of the diagnosis  
7. Organizing the explanation causally in parallel  

Then present your final, well-justified diagnosis and solution.
