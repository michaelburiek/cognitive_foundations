You are solving a **logical problem**, which involves reasoning about abstract relationships,
constraints, and implications in a precise and internally consistent way. Logical problems do not 
rely on domain knowledge; instead, they require you to detect structure, apply rules, and derive 
conclusions from the given information alone.

# Reasoning Structure for Logical Problems

Follow this structured reasoning approach optimized for logical problems. Each behavior contributes
to rigorous, step-by-step inference. The flow of reasoning is:

**selective-attention → logical-coherence → pattern-recognition → sequential-organization**
(while sequential-organization runs in parallel with adaptive-detail-management → compositionality → productivity)

---

## Phase 1: Selective Attention
**Goal**: Identify only the information that matters for the logical inference.
- Filter out irrelevant or distracting details
- Identify the propositions, conditions, and constraints that define the logical structure
- Clarify what is explicitly given vs. what must be inferred

↓ Proceed to constructing a consistent reasoning foundation ↓

## Phase 2: Logical Coherence
**Goal**: Build an internally consistent interpretation of the given information.
- Align all premises so they do not contradict one another
- Ensure each inference follows validly from prior steps
- Maintain strict adherence to logical rules, not assumptions

↓ Use coherence to surface deeper structures ↓

## Phase 3: Pattern Recognition
**Goal**: Detect structural patterns in the information.
- Notice repeated forms, symmetries, equivalences, or contrasts
- Identify conditional structures (if–then), logical operators, or relational patterns
- Use these patterns to identify the types of inferences that are possible

↓ Transform patterns into an ordered reasoning path ↓

## Phase 4: Sequential Organization (parallel with Adaptive Detail Management)
**Goal**: Lay out your inference steps in a clear, logically ordered progression.
- Break the reasoning process into discrete steps from premises → intermediate conclusions → final conclusion
- Ensure each step depends only on already-established information
- Present deductions in a clean, cumulative sequence

|| In parallel ||

## Phase 5: Adaptive Detail Management (containing Compositionality → Productivity)
**Goal**: Adjust the level of detail as needed during reasoning.
- Zoom in on complex sub-steps when necessary
- Zoom out when details are trivial or redundant
- Allocate detail to components that affect the overall logical chain

Within this process:

### Embedded Behavior — Compositionality
**Goal**: Build complex logical structures out of simple components.
- Combine atomic facts into compound propositions
- Decompose complex statements into simpler parts
- Integrate small inferences into larger, multi-step reasoning chains

And within compositionality:

### Embedded Behavior — Productivity
**Goal**: Generate all logically valid possibilities or pathways.
- Enumerate all candidate interpretations consistent with the premises
- Explore alternate chains of inference when applicable
- Do not stop at the first conclusion—ensure completeness by considering all meaningful permutations

# Your Task
Apply this complete reasoning structure to solve the logical problem. Make your reasoning process explicit by:
1. Demonstrating selective attention to the key logical elements
2. Maintaining logical coherence throughout the inference
3. Identifying structural patterns that guide the reasoning
4. Laying out your deductions sequentially
5. Managing detail levels appropriately while composing complex structures from simpler pieces
6. Generating all relevant logical possibilities before committing to a conclusion

Then provide the final logically derived answer.
