You are solving a decision-making problem, which involves selecting a single optimal option from a set of alternatives based on specific criteria. Decision-making problems require systematic evaluation and comparison to justify the best choice.

# Reasoning Structure for Decision-Making Problems

Follow this structured reasoning approach optimized for decision-making problems:

## Phase 1: Selective Attention
**Goal**: Identify the decision criteria, alternatives, and relevant information.
- Extract the key criteria for evaluating options
- Identify all available alternatives to choose from
- Filter out information that doesn't affect the decision
- Focus on factors that differentiate between options

↓ Then establish logical foundations ↓

## Phase 2: Logical Coherence
**Goal**: Ensure your decision framework is internally consistent.
- Verify that evaluation criteria don't contradict each other
- Establish a logically sound approach to comparing alternatives
- Ensure your reasoning about trade-offs is consistent
- Check that your decision logic flows coherently from criteria to choice

↓ Then generate evaluation dimensions ↓

## Phase 3: Productivity
**Goal**: Generate comprehensive ways to evaluate and compare alternatives.
- Create multiple evaluation frameworks or perspectives for comparing options
- Generate diverse criteria combinations to assess alternatives
- Produce varied scenarios or weightings to test decision robustness
- Develop novel ways to think about trade-offs between options

↓ Then manage decision objectives ↓

## Phase 4: Goal Management
**Goal**: Track and balance multiple decision objectives.
- Maintain focus on the primary decision goal throughout evaluation
- Manage competing objectives and trade-offs between criteria
- Track which criteria are most important for the decision
- Adjust priorities if new insights reveal different goal emphases

|| While simultaneously structuring the process ||

## Phase 5: Sequential Organization (parallel)
**Goal**: Structure your decision process in logical evaluation stages.
- Organize your reasoning into phases (e.g., criteria identification → option evaluation → comparison → selection)
- Ensure systematic progression through evaluation steps
- Build your decision incrementally through ordered analysis
- Establish clear progression from alternatives to final choice

↓ Both converge to domain-aligned reasoning ↓

## Phase 6: Knowledge-Structure Alignment
**Goal**: Align your decision-making with domain-specific frameworks and conventions.
- Apply decision-making frameworks appropriate to this domain (e.g., cost-benefit for business, risk-benefit for medical)
- Use domain-standard criteria and evaluation methods
- Structure your reasoning according to how experts in this field make similar decisions
- Leverage domain-specific knowledge about what matters in these choices

|| While simultaneously thinking conceptually ||

## Phase 7: Conceptual-Level Processing (parallel)
**Goal**: Reason with abstract decision concepts before verbalizing specifics.
- Build mental models of how each alternative would play out
- Reason abstractly about trade-off structures before detailing specifics
- Understand options at a conceptual level (what they fundamentally represent)
- Think through implications conceptually before committing to detailed analysis
