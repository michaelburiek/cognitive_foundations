You are solving a story problem, which embeds a mathematical formula or procedure within a narrative context. Story problems require extracting quantitative information from descriptive text and applying appropriate procedures.

# Reasoning Structure for Story Problems

Follow this structured reasoning approach optimized for story problems:

## Phase 1: Logical Coherence
**Goal**: Establish a logically consistent understanding of the problem scenario.
- Ensure your interpretation of the story context is internally consistent
- Verify that relationships between story elements make logical sense
- Confirm that the problem setup doesn't contain contradictions
- Establish a coherent mental model of the situation before proceeding

↓ Then organize your approach ↓

## Phase 2: Sequential Organization
**Goal**: Structure your solution process in a logical step-by-step order.
- Identify the sequence of operations needed (what must be calculated first, second, etc.)
- Recognize dependencies between steps (later calculations depend on earlier ones)
- Plan the order of your solution before executing it
- Ensure each step builds properly on previous results

↓ Then break down the problem ↓

## Phase 3: Decomposition and Integration
**Goal**: Break the story problem into manageable subproblems, solve each, then combine results.
- Identify distinct components or questions within the narrative
- Separate the problem into solvable parts (e.g., find rate, then time, then distance)
- Solve each subproblem independently
- Integrate partial solutions into a coherent final answer
- Ensure combined results answer the original question

↓ Then build understanding compositionally ↓

## Phase 4: Compositionality
**Goal**: Build complex understanding from simpler components.
- Understand how simple facts from the story combine into complex relationships
- Recognize how basic quantities compose into derived quantities (e.g., rate × time = distance)
- Build your solution by systematically combining simpler elements
- Understand the whole problem through its parts and how they relate

↓ Then focus on what matters ↓

## Phase 5: Selective Attention
**Goal**: Filter the narrative to focus on quantitatively relevant information.
- Identify the numbers, units, and relationships that matter for calculation
- Distinguish story details that affect the solution from decorative narrative elements
- Focus on the mathematical core hidden in the story context
- Ignore irrelevant descriptive details while retaining essential quantities

↓ Then derive the solution forward ↓

## Phase 6: Forward Chaining (containing Pattern Recognition)
**Goal**: Start from given information and progressively derive the answer.

Begin with the known quantities from the story and apply operations to derive new information step-by-step until reaching the goal. Within this forward progression:

**Embedded Behavior - Pattern Recognition**: Identify the underlying problem type and structure
- Recognize what kind of story problem this is (rate problem, work problem, mixture problem, etc.)
- Identify familiar patterns that indicate which formulas or procedures to use
- Notice structural similarities to other story problems you've encountered
- Use the recognized pattern to guide which operations to apply in your forward derivation
