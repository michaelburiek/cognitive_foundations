You are solving a **factual recall problem**, which requires retrieving precise information, 
definitions, descriptions, or procedural facts from memory or a known knowledge source. 
Unlike interpretive or generative tasks, factual recall emphasizes accuracy, clarity, and 
alignment with established information structures.

# Reasoning Structure for Factual Recall Problems

Follow this optimized reasoning structure. The flow of reasoning is:

**selective-attention → logical-coherence → forward-chaining → sequential-organization → 
knowledge-structure-alignment → adaptive-detail-management → temporal-organization**

---

## Phase 1: Selective Attention
**Goal**: Identify exactly what factual information the question is asking for.
- Determine the specific term, concept, definition, event, or procedural step being queried
- Ignore unrelated associations or interpretive tangents
- Focus on the minimal facts needed to answer accurately
- Distinguish primary information from supporting details

↓ Verify the factual content is consistent and error-free ↓

## Phase 2: Logical Coherence
**Goal**: Ensure your recalled information forms a consistent, non-contradictory statement.
- Check that the retrieved facts align with established knowledge
- Confirm that your explanation or definition is internally consistent
- Avoid mixing unrelated facts or concepts
- Keep the factual recall logically structured and precise

↓ Use this coherent structure to follow the logical chain of what the fact implies ↓

## Phase 3: Forward Chaining
**Goal**: Extend the factual recall through direct implications, subcomponents, or clarifications.
- Identify what the recalled fact logically entails
- Include any necessary supporting elements (e.g., properties, components, immediate consequences)
- Expand only as needed to provide a complete and accurate factual answer
- Ensure all additions follow directly from the recalled information

↓ Organize those elements into a clean factual sequence ↓

## Phase 4: Sequential Organization
**Goal**: Present the factual information in a clear, orderly manner.
- Break multi-part facts into logical steps, components, or layers
- Arrange information in a natural order (e.g., definition → features → example)
- Maintain clarity by structuring the recall from simple to specific
- Avoid presenting facts in a disordered or confusing way

↓ Align this sequence with established knowledge structures ↓

## Phase 5: Knowledge Structure Alignment
**Goal**: Fit the recalled information into its proper conceptual or categorical framework.
- Identify the domain the fact belongs to (e.g., biology, history, physics, math)
- Place the fact within its hierarchy: category → subcategory → instance
- Clarify how the fact relates to neighboring concepts
- Ensure the final explanation matches conventional organization in the field

↓ Adjust level of detail to match the question’s demands ↓

## Phase 6: Adaptive Detail Management
**Goal**: Provide the right amount of detail—neither too much nor too little.
- Expand details only when necessary for clarity or completeness
- Compress or omit extraneous specifics
- Adjust granularity based on whether the question asks for a definition, summary, list, or explanation
- Maintain a focus on the core factual content

↓ Place any temporally relevant facts in their proper time order ↓

## Phase 7: Temporal Organization
**Goal**: If the fact involves events or procedures, align them chronologically.
- Present historical or procedural facts in temporal order
- Ensure steps follow the correct sequence
- Maintain clarity if time is a defining part of the fact (e.g., “first… then…”)
- Use time-ordered reasoning only when applicable

# Your Task
Apply this full reasoning structure to recall the required factual information. Make your reasoning explicit by:
1. Identifying the exact fact being asked for  
2. Ensuring the recalled content is logically coherent  
3. Extending the fact via forward chaining only as needed  
4. Structuring the information sequentially  
5. Aligning the content with the relevant knowledge framework  
6. Adjusting the level of detail appropriately  
7. Incorporating temporal order when applicable  

Then provide the final factual answer.
