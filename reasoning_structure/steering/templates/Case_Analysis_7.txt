You are solving a **case analysis problem**, which involves interpreting a complex real-world 
situation with multiple interacting elements, ambiguous information, and overlapping goals. 
Case analysis requires identifying the most relevant details, structuring them, abstracting 
general principles, tracing causal and temporal relationships, and synthesizing a coherent, 
logically grounded interpretation or recommendation.

# Reasoning Structure for Case Analysis Problems

Follow this optimized reasoning structure. The flow of reasoning is:

**selective-attention → sequential-organization → abstraction → causal-organization → 
temporal-organization → conceptual-level-processing → logical-coherence**

---

## Phase 1: Selective Attention
**Goal**: Identify the most relevant details from a complex, information-rich scenario.
- Extract the essential facts, stakeholders, constraints, and events
- Ignore tangential or extraneous details that obscure the central dynamics
- Identify patterns of relevance and key signals within the case
- Distinguish between primary drivers and secondary background information

↓ Organize what you’ve selected into a structured reasoning path ↓

## Phase 2: Sequential Organization
**Goal**: Build a clear analytical workflow for understanding the case.
- Break down the case into sequential steps: describe → analyze → interpret → evaluate
- Ensure each step logically builds on the previous one
- Maintain a structured progression from concrete details to higher-level insight
- Keep the analysis transparent and cumulative

↓ Once structured, move from specifics to general principles ↓

## Phase 3: Abstraction
**Goal**: Identify underlying patterns, themes, and governing principles.
- Generalize from case-specific details to conceptual categories
- Extract broader concepts (e.g., risks, incentives, constraints, systemic factors)
- Treat the case as an instance of a broader class of situations
- Use abstraction to clarify what is essential versus situational

↓ Use these abstracted elements to map out causal relationships ↓

## Phase 4: Causal Organization
**Goal**: Construct a causal explanation of how the case dynamics unfolded.
- Identify the causes, mechanisms, and effects linking the key elements
- Build a clear cause-and-effect chain connecting conditions to outcomes
- Determine which factors were driving forces and which were reactive
- Distinguish between direct causes, enabling conditions, and indirect influences

↓ Anchor the causal narrative in the actual order of events ↓

## Phase 5: Temporal Organization
**Goal**: Align your causal explanation with the sequence of events.
- Reconstruct the timeline of actions, decisions, and consequences
- Ensure causes precede effects and the temporal order is realistic
- Identify time-sensitive dependencies or delays that shaped the outcome
- Detect temporal patterns (e.g., escalation, feedback, lag effects)

↓ Translate the timeline into deeper conceptual insight ↓

## Phase 6: Conceptual-Level Processing
**Goal**: Interpret the case using high-level concepts or theories.
- Connect the case to broader conceptual frameworks (e.g., organizational theory, 
  behavioral principles, risk models, systemic dynamics)
- Explain the deeper meaning or significance of the events
- Use conceptual reasoning to evaluate decisions or outcomes
- Clarify the general principles the case illustrates

↓ Ensure the entire analysis forms a coherent whole ↓

## Phase 7: Logical Coherence
**Goal**: Ensure your final explanation is internally consistent and well-supported.
- Check that all claims align with the evidence in the case
- Verify that your abstractions, causal story, and conceptual insights do not contradict one another
- Ensure the final interpretation logically follows from the earlier steps
- Present a cohesive and rationally connected analysis

# Your Task
Apply this full reasoning structure to analyze the case. Make your reasoning explicit by:
1. Identifying relevant details through selective attention  
2. Structuring the analysis sequentially  
3. Abstracting broader patterns and principles  
4. Organizing the case causally  
5. Anchoring causes and effects temporally  
6. Interpreting the case using conceptual insight  
7. Checking for complete logical coherence  

Then present your final integrated case analysis.
