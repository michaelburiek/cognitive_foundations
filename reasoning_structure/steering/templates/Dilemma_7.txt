You are solving a **dilemma problem**, which involves navigating a situation with two or more 
conflicting positions, each with meaningful trade-offs and no fully satisfactory resolution. 
Dilemmas require identifying the core tensions, generating alternatives, evaluating competing 
strategies, and reasoning through the causal implications of each pathway before forming an 
abstracted understanding of the underlying conflict.

# Reasoning Structure for Dilemma Problems

Follow this optimized reasoning structure. The flow of reasoning is:

**selective-attention → sequential-organization → productivity → strategy-selection → 
forward-chaining → causal-organization → abstraction**

---

## Phase 1: Selective Attention
**Goal**: Identify the competing positions and essential tensions within the dilemma.
- Extract the core conflicting values, goals, or constraints
- Isolate the central trade-off(s) that make the problem a dilemma
- Remove details that do not materially influence the conflict
- Identify what must be balanced, sacrificed, or prioritized

↓ Organize these tensions into a structured reasoning sequence ↓

## Phase 2: Sequential Organization
**Goal**: Lay out a clear process for comparing and evaluating the conflicting options.
- Structure the analysis into steps: clarify positions → generate options → evaluate → integrate
- Ensure each step builds logically from the previous one
- Maintain a transparent progression through the dilemma
- Move from understanding to exploration to evaluation

↓ Use this structure to generate multiple meaningful options ↓

## Phase 3: Productivity
**Goal**: Generate a diverse set of ways to approach the dilemma.
- Produce multiple interpretations, options, or reframings of the problem
- Consider alternative solutions, compromises, or hybrid approaches
- Avoid prematurely narrowing down the options
- Expand the option space before evaluating strategies

↓ Use these options to select the most appropriate strategy ↓

## Phase 4: Strategy Selection
**Goal**: Choose the reasoning strategy best suited for this specific dilemma.
- Consider whether to compare consequences, principles, risks, or value systems
- Evaluate which strategy exposes the key differences between options
- Justify why this strategy is appropriate for resolving (or illuminating) this dilemma
- Select the strategy before reasoning through consequences

↓ Apply the chosen strategy to infer downstream implications ↓

## Phase 5: Forward Chaining
**Goal**: Trace the implications of each position or option forward.
- Follow each option to its logical consequences
- Identify how each choice influences stakeholders, goals, risks, or constraints
- Evaluate whether any option reduces or worsens the dilemma
- Compare the implications across options to highlight trade-offs

↓ Organize these consequences into a coherent causal story ↓

## Phase 6: Causal Organization
**Goal**: Build a cause-and-effect map of the dilemma’s dynamics.
- Identify what causes which outcomes under each option
- Connect initial choices to intermediate effects and final consequences
- Clarify how competing values or constraints generate the conflict
- Distinguish root causes from surface-level tensions

↓ Use the causal model to extract general insights ↓

## Phase 7: Abstraction
**Goal**: Generalize the dilemma to a higher-level understanding.
- Identify the deeper principle or structural conflict underlying the dilemma
- Abstract away from the specific scenario to a broader conceptual pattern
- Clarify what this dilemma reveals about competing values, systems, or priorities
- Highlight how the abstracted insight helps interpret or evaluate the dilemma

# Your Task
Apply this full reasoning structure to analyze the dilemma. Make your reasoning explicit by:
1. Identifying the central tensions through selective attention  
2. Structuring the analysis sequentially  
3. Generating multiple options via productivity  
4. Choosing an appropriate evaluative strategy  
5. Reasoning forward through the consequences of each option  
6. Organizing those consequences causally  
7. Abstracting the dilemma to reveal deeper insights  

Then present your final, integrated analysis of the dilemma.
