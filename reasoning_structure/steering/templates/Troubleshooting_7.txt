You are solving a **troubleshooting problem**, which involves diagnosing a fault state by 
systematically identifying symptoms, tracing causal chains, and isolating the most probable source 
of failure. Troubleshooting problems require a structured, evidence-driven process for explaining 
what went wrong and why.

# Reasoning Structure for Troubleshooting Problems

Follow this structured reasoning approach optimized for troubleshooting. Each behavior contributes to 
building an accurate causal explanation. The flow of reasoning is:

**selective-attention → logical-coherence → pattern-recognition → sequential-organization → 
forward-chaining → temporal-organization → compositionality**

---

## Phase 1: Selective Attention
**Goal**: Identify the critical information relevant to diagnosing the fault.
- Extract the key symptoms, system behaviors, or anomalies
- Ignore irrelevant background details
- Identify which components, processes, or states are implicated
- Distinguish between primary symptoms and secondary noise

↓ Establish a logically consistent view of the situation ↓

## Phase 2: Logical Coherence
**Goal**: Build a consistent interpretation of all observed symptoms.
- Ensure that no hypothesis contradicts the known properties of the system
- Align all clues under a single coherent diagnostic frame
- Reject explanations that cannot fit all observed facts
- Maintain a strict cause-and-effect standard

↓ Use coherence to reveal diagnostic patterns ↓

## Phase 3: Pattern Recognition
**Goal**: Detect diagnostic patterns that suggest likely sources of failure.
- Identify recurring symptom clusters or known failure signatures
- Match patterns to prior faults, system models, or causal archetypes
- Notice inconsistencies or missing signals that may reveal system-level issues
- Use anomaly alignment to narrow the fault space

↓ Convert recognized patterns into an ordered reasoning pathway ↓

## Phase 4: Sequential Organization
**Goal**: Lay out a step-by-step diagnostic plan.
- Break the problem into ordered steps, from initial symptoms to deeper checks
- Reason from observable evidence → intermediate inferences → candidate fault hypotheses
- Ensure each step builds on validated information
- Maintain clarity in the progression of diagnostic reasoning

↓ Use the ordered plan to infer consequences through the system ↓

## Phase 5: Forward Chaining
**Goal**: Push implications forward through the system to test hypotheses.
- Given a hypothesis, infer what should happen next if it were true
- Compare expected consequences with actual system behavior
- Use mismatches to rule out incorrect hypotheses
- Use matches to strengthen the case for a likely fault source

↓ Anchor these forward inferences to the timeline of events ↓

## Phase 6: Temporal Organization
**Goal**: Align the fault explanation with the actual sequence of events.
- Construct a timeline linking events, system states, and symptoms
- Ensure that the fault explanation matches when each symptom occurred
- Identify causes that must precede effects and eliminate impossible sequences
- Use temporal consistency as a diagnostic filter

↓ Integrate the temporally coherent components into a full causal explanation ↓

## Phase 7: Compositionality
**Goal**: Build a complete fault explanation from smaller causal pieces.
- Combine local inferences into a system-level diagnosis
- Integrate component failures, temporal patterns, and causal implications
- Synthesize the most probable fault source that explains all symptoms
- Present a cohesive, well-structured causal model of the failure

# Your Task
Apply this complete reasoning structure to diagnose the troubleshooting problem. Make your reasoning 
process explicit by:
1. Identifying key symptoms using selective attention  
2. Building a logically coherent interpretation of all evidence  
3. Detecting relevant diagnostic patterns  
4. Organizing the diagnostic steps sequentially  
5. Using forward chaining to test hypotheses  
6. Structuring the timeline with temporal organization  
7. Composing all validated inferences into a final fault explanation  

Then present your final diagnosis clearly and concisely.
