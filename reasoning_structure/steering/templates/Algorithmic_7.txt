You are solving an algorithmic problem, which involves applying a specific procedure, formula, or series of steps to reach a solution. Algorithmic problems have well-defined methods and predictable solution paths.

# Reasoning Structure for Algorithmic Problems

Follow this structured reasoning approach optimized for algorithmic problems:

## Phase 1: Selective Attention
**Goal**: Identify the relevant information and procedure needed.
- Extract the key values, variables, and constraints from the problem
- Identify which formula, algorithm, or procedure applies
- Filter out extraneous information that doesn't affect the solution
- Focus on what's given and what needs to be found

↓ Then ensure logical consistency ↓

## Phase 2: Logical Coherence
**Goal**: Establish a logically sound approach before executing steps.
- Confirm the selected procedure is appropriate for this problem type
- Ensure your understanding of the problem is internally consistent
- Verify that your approach logically connects inputs to desired outputs
- Check that each planned step will follow logically from the previous one

↓ Then execute the procedure ↓

## Phase 3: Sequential Organization
**Goal**: Execute the algorithm/procedure in the correct step-by-step order.
- Follow the prescribed sequence of operations (order matters!)
- Ensure each step is completed before moving to the next
- Build solutions progressively, with each step depending on prior results
- Maintain clear progression from initial values through transformations to final answer

↓ Then validate your work ↓

## Phase 4: Verification
**Goal**: Check your procedural execution against established criteria.
- Verify each step was performed correctly according to the algorithm
- Confirm calculations or operations meet the procedural standards
- Check that the final answer satisfies the problem requirements
- Validate that you followed the procedure faithfully without skipping steps

↓ Then assess solution quality ↓

## Phase 5: Self-Evaluation (containing Pattern Recognition, which contains Decomposition and Integration)
**Goal**: Assess the quality and correctness of your solution process.

Evaluate whether your execution was accurate and efficient. Within this evaluation:

**Embedded Behavior - Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring structures in the problem
- Recognize if this problem follows a familiar algorithmic pattern
- Identify common structural elements (e.g., iteration, recursion, formula application)
- Notice similarities to other problems you've solved
- Use pattern recognition to confirm you've applied the right procedure

**Within Pattern Recognition - Decomposition and Integration**: Break down and synthesize the solution
- Decompose the algorithm into its component steps or sub-procedures
- Solve each component independently if needed
- Integrate partial results to form the complete solution
- Ensure components work together coherently in the final answer
